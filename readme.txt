- The data set consists of measurement data and simulation data.

- The measurement data is in CSV format to ensure easy use by various standard programs (Excel, Matlab) or own developed codes (Python). 

- The script "readin.m" reads the csv files into MatLab as table and struct. 

- The data contains vehicle data, battery data and heating data.

- The measurement data are divided into two categories. Category A was recorded in summer and does not contain all measured data due to trouble with the measurement system.  Category B was recorded in winter and is consistent. 

- The simulation data is taken from the validated model. The corresponding paper has been submitted and will be added here when it is published.

- The simulation data have a similar order as the measurement data and are available as csv and mat files.
